# curve-drawer
Draws a Cartesian or polar function using Python Turtle.

Program is slightly rudimentary.
The function to be graphed must be entered in curveDrawer.py under cartFunc(val) or polarFunc(theta), then uncomment the correct line at the bottom.
I feel this affords more flexibility with the function, but perhaps a object-oriented solution in Swing can be found for this...
